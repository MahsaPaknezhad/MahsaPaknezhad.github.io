Contrastive Learning is able to learn good latent representations that can be used to achieve high performance in downstream tasks. Supervised contrastive learning enhances the learned representations using supervised information. However, noisy supervised information corrupts the learned representations. In this blog post, I will summarize and simplify a paper published in CVPR 2022 that proposed an algorithm to learn high quality representations in existence of noisy supervised information. The title of this paper is "Selective Supervised Contrastive Learning with Noisy Labels".
