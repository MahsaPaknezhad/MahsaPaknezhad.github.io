Using Radiomics for Tree Bark Identification
------
Since the term was first coined in 2012, Radiomics has widely been used for medical image analysis. Radiomics refers to the automatic extraction of a large of number of features from medical images. These features have been able to uncover characteristics that can differentiate tumoral tissue from normal tissue and tissue at different stages of cancer. In this blog, we aim to show that Radiomic features can be useful for analysis of images in many other domains. The example we provide in this blog shows that radiomic features can be used for tree bark identification. We use a public dataset of tree bark images available from [here](https://www.vicos.si/resources/trunk12/).
