I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Datarock where we provide AI solutions for the mining industry. I develop and apply ML and AI algorithms to both structured geological data such as geophysical and geochemical data and unstructured geological data such as seismic and geophysical images. 

At Datarock, I have pioneered the development of cutting-edge AI and Computer Vision methodologies, including state-of-the-art techniques like self-supervised learning, open-set recognition, graph neural networks, inpainting using latent diffusion models and image registration, tailored specifically for geological datasets. I have also cultivated substantial expertise in harnessing the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), delving deep into the intricacies of this cloud service to optimize and streamline various computational processes and data management tasks. 

In this GitHub repository, I have put some of my code for different projects I have been working on my free time or while doing research. I have provided a brief explanation of the purpose of some of the most recent projects below. 


## Using Radiomics for Tree Bark Identification
Since the term radiomics was first coined in 2012, it has widely been used for medical image analysis. Radiomics is a method that automatically extracts a large of number of different features from medical images. These features have been able to uncover characteristics that can differentiate tumoral tissue from normal tissue and tissue at different stages of cancer.

In this project, we aim to show that radiomic features can be useful for analysis of images in other domains as well. As a example, we show that radiomic features can be used for tree bark identification. We use a public dataset of tree bark images which can be found [here](https://www.vicos.si/resources/trunk12/). All the code is provided in the [RadiomicsTutorial](https://github.com/MahsaPaknezhad/RadiomicsTutorial) repository.

## Parallel Learning for Robust and Transparent AI
In this project, we develop an algorithm for training a DL model on multiple tasks in a continual learning scenario. In contrast to the proposed algorithms where the DL model is trained on tasks sequentially, our proposed algorithm trains the DL model on the existing tasks in parallel. The parallel approach allows a DL model to learn generalizable representations and eliminates the problem of catastrophic forgetting which is common in sequential learning approaches. The diagram of the proposed algorithm is shown below.

## A Framework for Training Adversarially Robust Models With a Data Sparcity Hypothesis
Deep learning (DL) models have shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. To Mitigate adversarial vulnerability of DL models many algorithms have been proposed. However, a clear explanation for why DL models are susceptible to adversarial attacks is still lacking. We hypothesize that the adversarial vulnerability of DL models stems from two factors: 1) data sparsity and 2) the existence of many redundant parameters in the DL models. Owing to these factors, we believe different models can come up with different decision boundaries with comparably high prediction accuracy and that the appearance of the decision boundaries in the space around the class distributions does not affect the prediction accuracy of the model. We hypothesize that the ideal decision boundary is as far as possible from the class distributions. We developed a training framework to observe if DL models can learn such a decision boundary. 

We then measure adversarial robustness of the models trained using this training framework against well-known adversarial attacks and find that models trained using their framework, as well as regularization methods and adversarial training support our hypothesis of data sparsity and that models trained with these methods learn to have decision boundaries more like the aforementioned ideal decision boundary. We also show that the unlabeled data generated by noise is almost as effective on adversarial robustness as unlabeled data sourced from existing datasets or generated by synthesis algorithms. A diagram of our training framework is shown below.

## Whole Slide Image Registration
Whole slide images (WSI) are extremely high resolution microscopic images of multiple 2D slices cut from a tissue volume. The cutting and imaging process deforms the tissue in many ways. Such deformations include tearing, stretching, folding and compressing. Reconstructing the tissue volume by registering (aligning) the whole tissue in the acquired 2D WSI is therefore very complex and often results in poor outcomes. We propose a multi-resolution algorithm that registeres and reconstructs a region of interest in the whole slide images. The regional and multi-resolution approach results in more accurate reconsturction outcomes better than the state-of-the-art algorithms. A diagram of our multi-resolution approach is shown below. The region of interest (ROI) is show by a box in Level0 (highest resolution) of the WSI. The ROI is mapped to lower resolutions (Level1 and Level2) and registration is performed in these ROIs only.
